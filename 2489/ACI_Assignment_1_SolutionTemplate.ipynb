        "- Performance: The performance of the agent will be measured by the efficiency and speed of finding the optimal path from New Delhi to Chennai with the lowest cost, considering factors like time taken and expected speed on each route, as well as ensuring the safety of the disaster management team.\n",
        "- Environment: The agent operates within a graph environment representing different locations connected by routes. The environment is dynamic due to the aftermath of Cyclone Michaung, affecting the conditions of the paths.\n",
        "- Actuators: In this context, the actuators would be the virtual actions the agent can take: moving from one node to another in the graph and making decisions at each node based on the heuristic or fitness function.\n",
        "- Sensors: The agent's sensors would be the input it receives about the graph: the nodes (representing locations), the edges (representing routes), and the cost of each route (time, speed)."

It is designed to find the shortest path between a start node and a goal node in a graph. IDA* uses a recursive strategy, similar to depth-first search, but adds a cost limit (bound) that gradually increases with each iteration until the goal is found. This bound is based on the cost of the path (g) plus the estimated cost to reach the goal from the current node (h), known as the f-score in A* terminology."
